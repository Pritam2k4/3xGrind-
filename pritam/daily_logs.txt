Slow day, but solid library study with Manas; met Abhiram after many days.  
Taking GATE prep more seriously (friends’ momentum helps).  
Spent time with mom; cooked dinner for me and dad.  
Built a small email spam classifier in Python.  
Step by step—treating daily tasks with discipline and devotion.  
Ended the day with a peaceful walk.
